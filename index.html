                   <p class="text-sm mb-5 text-[#111111B3]">Flooding in Noakhali, Bangladesh, primarily occurs during the monsoon season from June to September, driven by heavy rainfall and the region's proximity to major rivers like the Meghna. This low-lying area is particularly vulnerable due to its geography, which can lead to overflowing rivers and inadequate drainage systems. The impacts are severe, resulting in displacement of communities, destruction of crops, and increased health risks from waterborne diseases. Additionally, infrastructure such as roads and homes often suffers significant damage, complicating recovery efforts. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of emergency relief, infrastructure improvements, and community awareness to enhance resilience against future flooding.</p>
